# README Generator


## ‚úèÔ∏è Description:

The point of this project is to give developers an easy, quick, and user friendly way to create readme files from scratch. The developer (or other user), will open an integrated terminal, and run Node on the index.js file. They will then be met with questions from npm inquirer. The questions will be be about the project in general, and these responses will be gathered and used in the actual generation of the readme file. Once complete, the readme file will generate and be put in the project, in the same file that the index.js is located. At this point, it is suggested that the user goes through and proofreads the file, and makes sure everything looks as expected. Once that is done, then the readme should be good to go, and the user can focus on more important areas of the code!
